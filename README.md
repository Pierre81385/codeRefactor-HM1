Code refactor homework assignment 4/15/2021

The HTML and CSS sheets in this assigment contained various outdated tags which were updated with more descriptive symantic tags. Comments are made in the HTML where major changes were made.

The style sheet contained numerous redundant elements, which have been consolidated through a more careful use of elements, classes, and ID's. Comments were made where changes occured, and most of the comments were consolidated to the bottom of the sheet because they're largely irrelivant.
